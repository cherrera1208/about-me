      <h1>Hello, I'm Carlos</h1>
      <p class="bio">
        I am a student of Web Development at CodeFellows. I served in the Navy
        for 5 years as a ComNav technician in the avionics department on board
        an LHD(amphibious ship). I have some college credits including general
        studies and introductory engineering courses. My initial goal was to use
        the GI Bill to study industrial engineering but have found myself more
        interested in the tech industry. I plan on becoming a junior web
        developer after CodeFellows, continuing to gain professional knowledge
        and experience -especially new languages like python, and potentially
        pursuing a bachelor's degree in a computer related subject.
